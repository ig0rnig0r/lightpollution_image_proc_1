An attempt to estimate relative contribution of different sources in the context of lightpollution for (small) cities.

Three different image files are compared to a reference to estimate how much less image brightness is present for each of them. The three images are modified manually to "black out" light sources from a specific type. 

There are three types:
    - Streetlights
    - Advertisments
    - Industry / Trainstation / Hospital

It should demonstrate how much "influence" each type of light source has relative to the others. 

Additionally the reference is crosschecked at the beginning, and also the number of fully saturated pixels are given (used to discuss if some super-bright light sources in reality are even brighter but the sensor clipped). 

The script output is written to "output.txt" to show the relative measurement results...
